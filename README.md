The goal of this course is to offer students an opportunity to exercise concepts learned in
previous courses in the form of a project. Groups of two (or three) students will select a topic for design and 
analysis of nuclear systems. Past projects are kept here as an example for possibilities of future projects.

Although the project topics are flexible, the past ones have close ties to balance of plant and to the content taught in a related course [Engy-4350](https://github.com/dpploy/engy-4350).
