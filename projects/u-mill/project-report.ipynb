    "&nbsp;&nbsp; Yellowcake is a material produced from uranium during the milling process. It is a mixture of different types of uranium oxide that combine to form a yellow tinted compound. This material is vital in the formation of reactor fuel in the later steps of the process known as uranium conversion. The two main processes used to recover uranium from the ground are In-Situ leaching and open-pit mining. In-Situ mining, which involves the injection of acid into the ground that dissolves uranium before being brought back to the surface in a pipe, is vastly more used in the US than open-pit because it allows a direct recovery of uranium without the need for digging out uranium bearing rock and moving it to a separate facility for processing. This does limit the places that the method can be used because the acid can contaminate groundwater if it is allowed to travel too deep. Once the uranium is pulled from the ground, it undergoes chemical separations to isolate the oxides.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;The general unit operations that follow the mining of the ore are size reduction (crushing/grinding), then acid leaching. The acid leaching process uses acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions with agitation for four to 48 hours at ambient temperature. Usually sulfuric acid is used and results in a final liquor with a pH of 1.5. Manganese dioxide is typically then used with the liquor to result in [UO2(SO4)3]2- The resulting uranium-oxide containing ions must then be separated using either a solvent extraction or ion exchange. The ion exchange usually uses an ion-exchange resin along with any of a variety of processing equipment such as fixed or moving bed along with another chemical solution to “sorb” the complex ion from the leach solution. Solvent extraction involves using alkyl phosphoric acids and alkyl amides as solvents to remove the ions containing uranium from their leach solution. The uranium oxide must then be precipitated from the solutions created by the solvent extraction or ion exchange. The resulting “yellow cake” as it is commonly referred to is a mix of uranium oxides which is then shipped to a final purification facility.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow cake, which is about 90% U3O8, is then chemically processed into uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) through a process called hydrofluorination. This reaction mechanism consists of heating beds of solid uranium oxide in an environment of gaseous hydrofluoric acid and stripping away the oxide layers until only UF4 remains. HF is typically used in a 20% stoichiometric excess to maximize the conversion percentage of U3O8 to at least 98%. Before the uranium can be enriched however, the UF4 must be further converted into UF6, also known as uranium hexafluoride. This is because enrichment is largely dependent on gaseous centrifugal separation, and UF6 does not possess a liquid form under standard pressure conditions. Uranium fluorides are also the preferred form for enrichment because fluorine only exists in one natural isotope, meaning that the heavier molecules will always contain the Uranium-238.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python code will be used to develop dynamic comprehensive systems that accurately represent the milling process as well as the complex parts of the plant that simulate a steady state reactor. This involves both mathematical models of the system’s material streams and visual representations of the data on a time dependent basis. Deliverable content will be prepared using Jupyter notebooks to seamlessly integrate working code with descriptive markdown text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are environmental and non-proliferation applications that come from developing a dynamic model simulating the steps of the uranium fuel cycle. For instance, disturbances to the system can be modeled to determine the impact on the immediate processes involved as well as the cascading effects on the next steps of the cycle. This information can lead to engineers designing risk mitigating and preventative measures that can make the system safer for operation and for the environment. This application is useful for the everchanging frontier of finite resource management. A major example is the White Mesa uranium mill in Utah, which already has a system in place where they take in low level radioactive waste from companies and reprocess it using their heap leaching treatment methods. If natural sources of uranium become depleted over the years, it is vital to understand and develop alternative methods of fuel production from nuclear waste as well as other uranium remnant sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Mesa Uranium Mill in Utah is the sole producer of uranium oxide in the United States, and operates using a heap based leaching approach. For the purposes of this model, we have selected White Mesa as the basis for the creation of modules. Upon examination of the flowsheet diagram created by White Mesa available in a 1993 IAEA report on the state of uranium milling, we have elected to model the following five unit operations in the milling process:leaching, clarification, solvent extraction, precipitation, and drying. These operations effectively encapsulate the majority of losses and operating costs in the uranium milling process, and capture both the very first and final stages of raw ore preparation in the production of uranium oxide.[3]\n"

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this project was initially proposed, we were expecting to model an In-Situ style uranium mill. This is due to the advantage of causing less ground disturbance for deeper reservoirs than with a traditional open pit mine, as well as the ability to be a one site process due to the removal of the ore crushing and transportation steps of the process. Even though this process shows promising signs, there is not much publicly available information on the operations of an In-Situ mine. This is most likely due to it being a newer method of uranium recovery with proprietary knowledge not yet being shared. As a result, this presented a challenge of finding a better option that still has realistic and useful applications. This was what led us to the option of modelling White Mesa’s heap leaching method. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advantages of modelling the White Mesa mill have already been mentioned. Being the only active uranium mill in the US makes it the only sensible option for a national based model. Groups interested in preserving and expanding our knowledge of the processes involved in the nuclear fuel cycle such as the Uranium Science and Technology Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee will be receiving their domestic milled uranium from White Mesa. By using this mill as an example, the exact chemical interactions and properties involved will be consistent with the physical product being used throughout all future lab scale operations conducted in the US.

The uranium is dissolved in the solution through a reaction described by [UO<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sup>+</sup> --> UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O]. In an acidic leaching solution the uranyl ion then combines with the sulphate ion, [UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> + 3(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup> --> UO<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub><sup>4-</sup>] to form a stable complex.

Acidic leaching is preferred over alkaline leaching where the ore contains less than 10% carbonates, typically sulfuric acid is used for acidic leaching and sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate is used for alkaline leaching. The oxidation reaction in acidic solutions is usually achieved by the ferric ion Fe<sup>3+</sup> acting as an electron transfer agent in the solution. In order to sustain this oxidation, pyrolosite, sodium chlorate, or Caro's acid can be used to regenerate the Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Alkaline leaching cannot sustain a high enough ferric ion concentration so higher pressure, temperature, leaching times, and a finer ore grind are needed. "

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranium filtration is the separation of solids from a slurry stream that allows liquid through pores. This step of the nuclear fuel cycle comes after the initial leaching of the raw ore and prepares the product stream by partially purifying it before it is sent to a solvent extraction device. If the presence of impurities reaches 200ppm it can lead to column plugging which can halt the solvent extraction process entirely, so the accepted practice is to keep the value at 10ppm or less. The unit operation involved is a vacuum drum filter with stacked filter leaves that continuously purify the feed liquid. Filterability of the feed is predetermined using a sample of the feed with a single filter leaf. The filtration rate of the bulk system is controlled via the use of induced vacuum through the drum or added pressure to the stream.[5]  \n",
