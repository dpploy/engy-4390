    "&nbsp;&nbsp; Yellowcake is a material produced from uranium during the milling process. It is a mixture of different types of uranium oxide that combine to form a yellow tinted compound. This material is vital in the formation of reactor fuel in the later steps of the process known as uranium conversion. The two main processes used to recover uranium from the ground are In-Situ leaching and open-pit mining. In-Situ mining, which involves the injection of acid into the ground that dissolves uranium before being brought back to the surface in a pipe, is vastly more used in the US than open-pit because it allows a direct recovery of uranium without the need for digging out uranium bearing rock and moving it to a separate facility for processing. This does limit the places that the method can be used because the acid can contaminate groundwater if it is allowed to travel too deep. Once the uranium is pulled from the ground, it undergoes chemical separations to isolate the oxides.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;The general unit operations that follow the mining of the ore are size reduction (crushing/grinding), then acid leaching. The acid leaching process uses acidic and alkaline aqueous solutions with agitation for four to 48 hours at ambient temperature. Usually sulfuric acid is used and results in a final liquor with a pH of 1.5. Manganese dioxide is typically then used with the liquor to result in [UO2(SO4)3]2- The resulting uranium-oxide containing ions must then be separated using either a solvent extraction or ion exchange. The ion exchange usually uses an ion-exchange resin along with any of a variety of processing equipment such as fixed or moving bed along with another chemical solution to “sorb” the complex ion from the leach solution. Solvent extraction involves using alkyl phosphoric acids and alkyl amides as solvents to remove the ions containing uranium from their leach solution. The uranium oxide must then be precipitated from the solutions created by the solvent extraction or ion exchange. The resulting “yellow cake” as it is commonly referred to is a mix of uranium oxides which is then shipped to a final purification facility.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow cake, which is about 90% U3O8, is then chemically processed into uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) through a process called hydrofluorination. This reaction mechanism consists of heating beds of solid uranium oxide in an environment of gaseous hydrofluoric acid and stripping away the oxide layers until only UF4 remains. HF is typically used in a 20% stoichiometric excess to maximize the conversion percentage of U3O8 to at least 98%. Before the uranium can be enriched however, the UF4 must be further converted into UF6, also known as uranium hexafluoride. This is because enrichment is largely dependent on gaseous centrifugal separation, and UF6 does not possess a liquid form under standard pressure conditions. Uranium fluorides are also the preferred form for enrichment because fluorine only exists in one natural isotope, meaning that the heavier molecules will always contain the Uranium-238.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python code will be used to develop dynamic comprehensive systems that accurately represent the milling process as well as the complex parts of the plant that simulate a steady state reactor. This involves both mathematical models of the system’s material streams and visual representations of the data on a time dependent basis. Deliverable content will be prepared using Jupyter notebooks to seamlessly integrate working code with descriptive markdown text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are environmental and non-proliferation applications that come from developing a dynamic model simulating the steps of the uranium fuel cycle. For instance, disturbances to the system can be modeled to determine the impact on the immediate processes involved as well as the cascading effects on the next steps of the cycle. This information can lead to engineers designing risk mitigating and preventative measures that can make the system safer for operation and for the environment. This application is useful for the everchanging frontier of finite resource management. A major example is the White Mesa uranium mill in Utah, which already has a system in place where they take in low level radioactive waste from companies and reprocess it using their heap leaching treatment methods. If natural sources of uranium become depleted over the years, it is vital to understand and develop alternative methods of fuel production from nuclear waste as well as other uranium remnant sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Mesa Uranium Mill in Utah is the sole producer of uranium oxide in the United States, and operates using a heap based leaching approach. For the purposes of this model, we have selected White Mesa as the basis for the creation of modules. Upon examination of the flowsheet diagram created by White Mesa available in a 1993 IAEA report on the state of uranium milling, we have elected to model the following five unit operations in the milling process:leaching, clarification, solvent extraction, precipitation, and drying. These operations effectively encapsulate the majority of losses and operating costs in the uranium milling process, and capture both the very first and final stages of raw ore preparation in the production of uranium oxide.[3]\n"

    "For this project we will be utilizing GitHub to store a remote repository of our python code and project report. GitHub is a version control software that programmers use to share and work on coding projects together. This allows for users to view the contribution history easily and rollback changes if needed. GitHub interfaces with git to create a graphical user interface for the git repository. This allows for GitHub to add some of its own tools on top of git making it much more powerful. One of these tools is the Network Graph that allows users to see all branches of the repository and all commits along with dates that changes were made. Another tool is viewing the version history of a specific file by opening it on the GitHub repository. This shows all changes made to that file including commit numbers, dates of changes, and more. This makes it much easier to go back in time to see the history of the project and see who made which changes. At its core, a GitHub repository is a mirror of a git repository with any changes being submitted through GitHub automatically being sent to the git repository as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work on a git repository you first must clone the repository to your computer using the git clone command. This creates a clone of the remote repository on your computer which is then called the local repository. It will also create a copy of this local repository called the working directory. All edits made by the user are found in the working directory and do not impact the local repository until a commit is made. Next the user will create their own branch using the git branch command. This branch is a copy of the repository that the user will use to make all of their changes without impacting the main branch. This makes it easier for the repository maintainer to control the changes made to the project since they can view differences between the main branch and one of the user branches. This helps to prevent branch conflicts from creating bugs or other errors on the main branch of the repository. When a user is satisfied with a contribution, they will create a commit using the git commit command. The user will write a brief one line description of what has been changed followed by a longer description with much more detail. A comparison is then made between the working directory and the local repository to see which changes have been made. Any changes in the working directory will be compiled into the commit and saved for later. Commits serve as documentation for changes and are vital to using git. The short description allows for the repository maintainer to easily see what changes are being made to the project, but still allows for technical details to be documented in the long description.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user wants to publish their commits to the remote repository for other users to see there is a specific procedure that must be followed. This is to prevent any conflicts from arrising in the final step where the local repository is merged with the remote repository by the repository maintainer. First, the user must update their copy of the local repository to obtain the latest version of the project. This step is very important and prevents merge conflicts since the local repository is going to be merged into the remote repository in the final step. Updating the local repository is done by using the git fetch command followed by the git merge command. This can also be done using the git pull command which executes both commands on the target repository. The git fetch command compares the local repository to the target showing all of the differences between the two. This also downloads all of the commits missing on the local repository so they can be reviewed by the user. The git merge command merges all commits that are missing from the target repository into the local repository. This process effectively creates a copy of the remote repository on the user's computer, but also includes any saved commits. Following this process, the git push command can be used to push the unuploaded commits onto the remote repository. Since a separate branch was created earlier, this branch must be merged into the main branch so other users can see these changes. This can be done by running git merge on the main branch to merge the main branch into the user's branch. Now the local repository is updated with the changes of all other users with the remaining commits that are trying to be published to the remote repository. Finally the user now has to make a request to the repository maintainer to run git pull on their local repository. This is known as a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub helps to make the pull request process easier by integrating it into their platform. All active pull requests can be viewed on the repository website with a discussion section where users can discuss any problems they find with the changes. In addition to this, GitHub streamlines the process through the use of the GitHub desktop app. Instead of running all of the git commands through the command line, they can all be executed directly via GitHub desktop. After downloading GitHub desktop it prompts the user to clone a repository and either login or create an account. This sets up a local repository and working directory for the user with an account to GitHub where all of their commits and pull requests will be logged. After creating changes to the files in the working directory, GitHub desktop will show the user the current differences between the working directory and the local repository. A commit window is displayed on the left hand side of the page where commits can be created easily. In order to publish changes to the remote repository there are recommended prompts that will walk the user through the pull, push, and pull request process. If the user needs to run one of the other git commands these can also be accessed at the top by clicking on Repository and selecting the desired command to run.\n",

The full open-source code can be found on Github, where anyone can download and use the library and its available unit operation modules. The Github repository also contains examples that use the code to simulate various chemical interactions while delivering time dependent data. \n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupyter Notebook is also open-source, and it is a way to integrate ordinary text with multiple programming languages such as Python. Python is a widely used programming language that can be likened to a more simplified version of C. This is a popular language for dynamic modelling and has been in use for over thirty years. It is commonplace in many programs used in the nuclear industry, making it a great candidate for this project. "

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this project was initially proposed, we were expecting to model an In-Situ style uranium mill. This is due to the advantage of causing less ground disturbance for deeper reservoirs than with a traditional open pit mine, as well as the ability to be a one site process due to the removal of the ore crushing and transportation steps of the process. Even though this process shows promising signs, there is not much publicly available information on the operations of an In-Situ mine. This is most likely due to it being a newer method of uranium recovery with proprietary knowledge not yet being shared. As a result, this presented a challenge of finding a better option that still has realistic and useful applications. This was what led us to the option of modelling White Mesa’s heap leaching method. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the advantages of modelling the White Mesa mill have already been mentioned. Being the only active uranium mill in the US makes it the only sensible option for a national based model. Groups interested in preserving and expanding our knowledge of the processes involved in the nuclear fuel cycle such as the Uranium Science and Technology Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee will be receiving their domestic milled uranium from White Mesa. By using this mill as an example, the exact chemical interactions and properties involved will be consistent with the physical product being used throughout all future lab scale operations conducted in the US.

In an acidic leaching solution the uranyl ion then combines with the sulphate ion, [UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> + 3(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sup>2-</sup> --> UO<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub><sup>4-</sup>] to form a stable complex.

Acidic leaching is preferred over alkaline leaching where the ore contains less than 10% carbonates, typically sulfuric acid is used for acidic leaching and sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate is used for alkaline leaching. The oxidation reaction in acidic solutions is usually achieved by the ferric ion Fe<sup>3+</sup> acting as an electron transfer agent in the solution. In order to sustain this oxidation, pyrolosite, sodium chlorate, or Caro's acid can be used to regenerate the Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Alkaline leaching cannot sustain a high enough ferric ion concentration so higher pressure, temperature, leaching times, and a finer ore grind are needed. "

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranium filtration is the separation of solids from a slurry stream that allows liquid through pores. This step of the nuclear fuel cycle comes after the initial leaching of the raw ore and prepares the product stream by partially purifying it before it is sent to a solvent extraction device. If the presence of impurities reaches 200ppm it can lead to column plugging which can halt the solvent extraction process entirely, so the accepted practice is to keep the value at 10ppm or less. The unit operation involved is a vacuum drum filter with stacked filter leaves that continuously purify the feed liquid. Filterability of the feed is predetermined using a sample of the feed with a single filter leaf. The filtration rate of the bulk system is controlled via the use of induced vacuum through the drum or added pressure to the stream.[5]  \n",

In order to make this a time dependent process, the wash ratio per stage (or the change in concentration per stage) is found using Navier-Stoke's law for the settling velocity of solids as seen in figure D.3 below. \n",

    "Uranium filtration is the separation of solids from a slurry stream that allows liquid through pores. This step of the nuclear fuel cycle comes after the initial leaching and rough decantation of the raw ore and prepares the product stream by further purifying it before it is sent to a solvent extraction device. If the presence of impurities reaches 200ppm it can lead to column plugging which can halt the solvent extraction process entirely, so the accepted practice is to keep the value at 10ppm or less. The unit operation involved is a vacuum drum filter with stacked filter leaves that continuously purify the feed liquid. Filterability of the feed is predetermined using a sample of the feed with a single filter leaf. The filtration rate of the bulk system is controlled via the use of induced vacuum through the drum or added pressure to the stream.[3] \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the open pit and heap leaching process disturbing a large piece of the environment relative to what is extracted for fuel, most of the removed impurities are recovered as tailings. There are environmental requirements for the quality of tailings such as the maximum allowable ppm of harmful acids, therefore the contents of the tailings must be modelled both to account for the overall mass balance and the environmental requirements for safe operation. \n",

Since there is a limit to the operating pressure in the system, the maximum pressure difference is the upper bound limit. The increase in resistance to filtration due to the buildup of cake is pressure dependent, as explained in Darcy’s law of cake filtration. Rotary drum filtration is the best option due to its increased permeation rate that increases as a result of the tangential style of contact with the liquid stream. \n",

    "The total time of a cycle through the drum is typically 3-6x the cake formation time. Typical inputs from the leaching process include soluble uranyl carbonate complex ion [UO2(CO3)3]4- dissolved in (typically) sulfuric acid. Impurities in the liquor are metals, such as vanadium, molybdenum, thorium, aluminum, and iron as well as sulfate ions. The equation can be rearranged to solve for the flowrate of clean feed liquid, as shown in Figure D.4. This equation represents the rate of production, or the effective output of solvent-extraction ready aqueous solution containing the uranyl sulfate from leaching. It can also be used to find the amount of residue removed in the cake, which should amount to 90% of the post-CCD concentration of impurities. The module will contain the input and output streams that connect it to leaching and solvent extraction respectively, but a separate waste stream will also be produced with its own level of purity to ensure full accountability for all uranium-based materials.

It should be noted that several mill operations that precipitate ammonium diuranate from ammonium sulfate strip solutions are able to calcine at lower temperatures and produce products within all specifications listed in the table above. The process to create the ammonium dinitrate requires an addition of an ammonia solution, thus the precipitation reaction can occur with uranyl sulfate as mentioned before (Will Make Sense with Addition of Precipitation Stage).\n",
