    "Solvent extraction, also known as liquid-liquid extraction, is the partition of metal complexes from two immiscible liquids. The two most common liquids used are one aqueous and one organic. Solvent extraction works on the exploitation of the relative solubility of the solute (metal complexes) in the two phases. The chemical potentials of each input make up the driving force of the transfer. Increased stabilitiy of the products as compared to the initial solution is necessary to increase the driving force. The solute enters the extraction system in the aqeuous feed stream and is extracted by the incoming solvent/organic stream. The feed is reduced and exits the extraction system as the raffinate stream; the solvent stream absorbs and exits the extraction system as the extract stream. Solvent extraction products do need further purification by methods such as percipitation, distillation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solvent extraction is chosen as the necessary separation technique due to the high precision and accuracy of the separation. All based on the proper selection of the solvent, individual and specific complexes can be removed from the feed stream with substancial levels of exactness. Additional extraction tanks can be added to the system to see extraction percentages close to 100%. Morover, solvent extraction plus a distillation or percipitation process is chosen over just one of the former because of the increased simplicity of the distillation/precipitation process after solvent partitioning. All the benefits of solvent extraction are based on the choice of solvent.\n",
