#addition of sodium hydroxide
2 Na4UO2[CO3]3(s) + 6 NaOH(a) -> Na2U2O7(s) + 6 Na2CO3(a) + 3 H2O(l)

#amonium hydrate and gaseous amaonia reaction
2 UO2[SO4]3^-4(a) + 6 NH3(a) -> [NH4]2U2O7(s) + 4 SO4^-2(a)

#The precipitation is usually carried out using a mixture of gaseous ammonia
#and air at a ratio of 1:3. The temperature is held at 30 to 50Â°C, and the terminal
#pH value is between seven and eight.

# forming ammonium diuranate (ADU)
2 UO2[SO4]3^-4(a) + 2 NH3(a) + 6 H2O(l) -> [UO2]1SO4[OH]2(s) + 4 H2O(s)

#both of the next two should have water terms on both sides of the equation but #were outputting errors as the water terms were repeated on both sides of the #equation
#using milk magnesia
UO2SO4(a) + MgO(s) -> UO3(s) + MgSO4(a)

#acid along side hydrogen peroxide
UO2^2(a) + H2O2(a) -> UO4(s) + 2 H^+(a)
