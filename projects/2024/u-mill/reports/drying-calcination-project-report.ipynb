    "The incoming ammonium diuranate (ADU) slurry produced by precipitation now has to undergo a drying and calcination process at extremely high temperatures. While the centrifuge in the precipitation process drove out most of the water, it needs to be completely evaporated to obtain the final product. The product being fed into the drying and calcination section of the milling process mainly contains ammonium diuranate. This ammonium diuranate undergoes dehydration and oxidation to produce the coveted triuranium octoxide. These processes take place in a multi hearth furnace. A diagram of one of these furnaces can be found in Figure 1.\n",

    "__Calcination Process__\n",
    "\n",
    "The second stage of the drying process is known as calcination. In terms of the overall process it will follow a similar basis to that of evaporation, but at a higher temperature. However, there are some distinguishable differences in calcination since the feed is now mostly a pure solid. Calcination involves the heating of solids to a high temperature for the purpose of removing volatile substances, oxidizing a portion of mass, or rendering them friable. Therefore, this stage in the drying process is sometimes considered a process of absolute purification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage is not similar to the \"evaporation\" stage because it is a whole different piece of equipment at a much larger temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "This production happens in large molar quantities, and assuming a 100% conversion rate every 100 kgs of ammonium diuranate will result in 90 kgs of triuranium octoxide. High temperature calcining is practiced producing a greater than 94% U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> product having high density [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Calcination eliminates water completely, and drives off the ammonia, but care must be taken not to sinter the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sintering can significantly reduce nitric acid solubility, which is critical for some refining processes. Several types of drying equipment have been used in the calcining process, typically arranged in the series of dryers that succeed the main calciner tank. These include single or multiple hearth dryers, drum dryers, belt dryers, screw dryers and radiant heat dryers. There also becomes the problem of how to dispose of the ammonia used as a \"sweep-gas\" to drive the heat transfer in the calciner. As seen in figure 4, the solution to the produced ammonia is to add a form of fluid bed dryer to the calciner tank to extract the ammonia vapor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Modeling the Module__\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this process, the process needs to remain seperated by the two main stages of drying. Thus, two seperate subsections to this module will be created for both evaporation and calcination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with evaporation, this basis of the model needed some input parameters to work with. The feed mass flowrate was determined to be 5800 kg/min, along with a  set overall volume of 400m<sup>3</sup> (remember there are two tanks). The third and final parameter that will be monitored is the product mass density, which is being feed in at \n",
    "\n",
    "a paramter had to be selected to base the model after that would be able to monitor the amount of flow entering and exiting the tank. This was chosen to be the liquid volume of the evaporator tank, but it came with some conflicts. Being able to differentiate whether the tank was filling, evaporating, or discharging into the next stage was difficult to determine using only this parameter. \n"
