    "__Uranium Drying Overview__\n",
    "\n",
    "The incoming ammonium diuranate slurry produced by precipitation now has to undergo a drying process at extremely high temperatures. While the centrifuge in the precipitation process drove out most of the water, it needs to be completely evaporated to obtain the final product. The product being fed into the drying section of the milling process mainly contains ammonium diuranate, which is dried to produce the coveted triuranium octoxide. The entire drying process can be split up into two stages; drying, which is the thermal removal of water from the ammonium diurante, and calcination, which is the chemical conversion of ammonium diuranate to U3O8. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reactions that will happen based off each of the stages. In the drying stage, heat will be applied to the ammonium diurante slurry, evaporating the water and separating the water vapor from the slurry. This equation is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During the calcination stage, the slurry is hit with a much greater amount of heat, chemically changing the compostion of the ammonium diuranate to the coveted triuranium octoxide product. This reaction is given as:\n",
    "9(NH4)2U2O7(l)  14NH3 + 15H2O + 2N2 + 6U3O8\n",
    "\n",
    "As a whole, this reaction can be summarized as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Production of Triuranium Octoxide*\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "<center>9(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>0<sub>7</sub> → 14NH<sub>3</sub> + 15H<sub>2</sub>O + 2N<sub>2</sub> + 6U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Calcination Process__\n",
    "\n",
    "The second stage of the drying process is known as calcination. In terms of the overall process it will follow a similar basis to that of evaporation, but at a higher temperature. However, there are some distinguishable differences in calcination since the feed is now mostly a pure solid. Calcination involves the heating of solids to a high temperature for the purpose of removing volatile substances, oxidizing a portion of mass, or rendering them friable. Therefore, this stage in the drying process is sometimes considered a process of absolute purification.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage is not similar to the \"evaporation\" stage because it is a whole different piece of equipment at a much larger temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "This production happens in large molar quantities, and assuming a 100% conversion rate every 100 kgs of ammonium diuranate will result in 90 kgs of triuranium octoxide. High temperature calcining is practiced producing a greater than 94% U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> product having high density [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Calcination eliminates water completely, and drives off the ammonia, but care must be taken not to sinter the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sintering can significantly reduce nitric acid solubility, which is critical for some refining processes. Several types of drying equipment have been used in the calcining process, typically arranged in the series of dryers that succeed the main calciner tank. These include single or multiple hearth dryers, drum dryers, belt dryers, screw dryers and radiant heat dryers. There also becomes the problem of how to dispose of the ammonia used as a \"sweep-gas\" to drive the heat transfer in the calciner. As seen in figure 4, the solution to the produced ammonia is to add a form of fluid bed dryer to the calciner tank to extract the ammonia vapor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sizing and Cost__\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of each of the main columns used in this process will prove to be vital to the overall drying module. For evaporation, it was determined that there would be 2 columns used in this process. Each of these columns would be sized at 200m<sup>3</sup>. For calcination, it was determined that 2 MHF units would be utilized. Each of these calciner unites would have an overall volume of 350m<sup>3</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall cost of this operation will be strictly based on the main unit operations involved in the process. Thus, it will mainly pertain to the evapotator and calciner columns. For the evaporator tank, it will utilize a stainless steel material to withstand the high temperatures the system is going to be exposed to. Using (x), it is assumed that the cost of each of the 200m<sup>3</sup> falling film evaporator columns using this material will be 28,700 dollars. For the calciner, it will also utilize stainless steel, but will also include an interior refactory brick layer since it will have a low thermal conductivity during the heat reaction. This in turn will not only lead to protection of the stainless steel outer layer, but will also yield greater energy efficiency for the overall heating process. Using (x), each of the MHF calciner units, with a capacity of 350m<sup>3</sup>, will cost 75,370 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "In total, the overall drying process will cost approximately 208,140 dollars to construct and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Modeling the Module__\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this process, the process needs to remain seperated by the two main stages of drying. Thus, two seperate subsections to this module will be created for both evaporation and calcination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with evaporation, this basis of the model needed some input parameters to work with. The feed mass flowrate was determined to be 5800 kg/min, along with a  set overall volume of 400m<sup>3</sup> (remember there are two tanks). The third and final parameter that will be monitored is the product mass density, which is being feed in at \n",
    "\n",
    "a paramter had to be selected to base the model after that would be able to monitor the amount of flow entering and exiting the tank. This was chosen to be the liquid volume of the evaporator tank, but it came with some conflicts. Being able to differentiate whether the tank was filling, evaporating, or discharging into the next stage was difficult to determine using only this parameter. \n"
