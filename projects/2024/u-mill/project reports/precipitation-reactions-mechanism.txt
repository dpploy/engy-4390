#addition of sodium hydroxide
2 Na4UO2[CO3]3(o) + 6 NaOH(a) -> Na2U2O7(v) + 6 Na2CO3(s) + 3 H2O(a)

#amonium hydrate and gaseous amaonia reaction
2 UO2[SO4]3^-4(a) + 6 NH3(a) -> [NH4]2U2O7(a) + 4 SO4^-2(a)

#The precipitation is usually carried out using a mixture of gaseous ammonia
#and air at a ratio of 1:3. The temperature is held at 30 to 50Â°C, and the terminal
#pH value is between seven and eight.
