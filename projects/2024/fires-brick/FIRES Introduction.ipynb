    "This report will be about an investigation into the testing of a more viable material option for constructing high-temperature firebrick resistance-heated enerfy storage (FIRES). We are planning reviewing three different materials. Chromium Dioxide, Nickle Oxide and finally Magnisium Oxide. These materials will then be compared with Aluminium Oxide as well as go through similar tests. Air is the primary carrier for removal of heat in the system but other carriers can also be investigated. \n",

We don't know the values of the temperature at the ends of the domain, even.
