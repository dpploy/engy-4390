Neutron are particles that are eletrically neutral and can travel through matter with comparatively little interaction. Neutrons are generated by nuclear processes in nuclear reactors, and as such detecting neutrons--by interacting with matter--can be better understood by modelling their diffusion through matter. We strive here to model an idealized case of neutrons being generated and diffused in a spherical domain across two regions: a small inner region, and a larger outer region.
