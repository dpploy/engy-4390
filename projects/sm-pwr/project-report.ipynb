    "- As nuclear power continues to find its niche in the energy market, we are seeing an increasing trend towards Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The benefit to SMRs is their small plant area, modularized reactor design allowing for more cost effective manufacturing, and their low level of operator interaction. "

    "- The NuScale 720 integral PWR has been under design for close to two decades. The 720 offers a safe design which uses no active components. Instead, the design relies primarily on gravity and natural convection which decreases the maintenance requirements of the system. NuScale Power Modules™ will be manufactured in factories, allowing for a monumental increase in production - the likes of which has never been seen by any other nuclear power plant design. With 2027 being the projected year for the first commercially operated plant, the NuScale 720 looks to become a mainstay in power generation for the U.S. "

    "- In the NuScale 720 design, the 12 modular reactors are submerged in a pool of water that acts as a heat sink. This pool is designed to respond to reactor conditions by drying up when external power is shut off. This leads to an air cooling mode that can be used in the case of long term (< 30 days) power shutdown. This is the only point where the different reactors influence each other, so it is imperative that each of our cores relates back to this water basin."

    "- Figure 3 shows how each of the components of our model will feed into each other. The first step to building our model is to outline the inputs, outputs, and equations that govern each individual module in our simulation. Starting at our reactor, information about the tank (such as the level and temperature) go into our reactor module along with instructions from the controller, and feedback from the pressurizer. The reactor then outputs information about the primary loop flow to the steam generator which converts that input information into a steam output. This output steam information is then fed into the turbine system which calculates High, Intermediate, and Low condensate pressures as well as sending excess steam to a condenser that has feedback from a cooling tower. These different condensates from the turbine and the condenser feed into each other until they get to a high pressure feedwater heater tank that outputs information back into the starting reactor."
