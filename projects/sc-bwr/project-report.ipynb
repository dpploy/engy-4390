    "Much attention is paid in both college curriculum and classroom writing to the functioning of nuclear reactors, but equally important to the kinetics within the reactor itself is the operation of the balance of plant as a whole. These operations are often what determines the overall thermodynamic efficiency of the entire plant, and the control systems present within it can have as much of an effect on the conditions within the reactor as the behavior of the neutrons of the thermo-hydraulic relationship between the reactor moderator and overall reactivity. Tripped turbines can result in pressure increases within the reactor and are an essential part of most startup sequences (especially for [Supercritical Water Reactors [1]](#ref1)), poor control of condensers can lead to cavitation in pumps and loss of coolant flow to the reactors (which interestingly enough is one of the proposed causes of the [Chernobyl Disaster [2]](#ref2)), and pressure suppression systems can result in instability if not managed or modeled properly (another proposed cause of the [Chernobyl Disaster [3]](#ref3)). It is therefore imperative that reactor kinetics be simulated in concert with the behavior of the system designed to support and draw power from it. This is however quite difficult, as simulating the reactor itself is already a daunting enough task. As of yet, there are very few purpose-built systems for simulating the behavior of an entire nuclear plant, with most of these being training programs designed to model only a single specific nuclear plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the lack of large amounts of plant simulation software is probably due to the complexity of simulating so many different systems at once (the reactor, pumps, condensers, turbines and control systems, all with dozens of differential equations required to model them properly). However, a solution to this exists in the [Cortix](#ref4) library, which makes it relatively easy to model a large, distributed system consisting of several discrete processes linked together. Our work involved the creation of a set of modules which would simulate the operation of a boiling water reactor, turbines and condensers, and then link them together using Cortix’s networking capabilities. This would serve as both a test of its modeling capabilities, as well as a basis for future work in balance of plant modeling as the modules can be used and implemented by other researchers within their own Cortix simulations."

    "Before going into depth on the design and interplay of the modules we created, we must describe in detail how Cortix works. The system itself allows several models to be implemented, connected and run through a series of time steps while passing information between each other. An example graphic is shown on the following page. Individual modules (the smaller squares), which are generally in the form of time-dependent differential equations with input and output values, are instantiated in the Cortix environment. These modules may then be connected together in a manner consistent with the system that needs to be modeled (e.g. a module simulating a nuclear reactor would connect to a turbine module and an inlet coolant pump module). The connections themselves are how modules transmit data to each other, with the information being passed generally being the output of a state equation of one module that is required for calculations by another module. The entire system runs within the Cortix environment, which handles the evolution of the modules themselves from their start to end times, as well as data passing between them through their connections."

    "Each module within the Cortix environment is an instantiation of a class of modules representing a certain time of process or object (for example, a turbine class, a reactor class, a pump class, etc). These classes themselves are all subclasses of the abstract “Module” class, which provides the “send” and “recv” functions which are required to send data between the modules. Each subclass will also contain a set of parameters, internal functions and state variables which are unique to every class. The functions are typically used to calculate output or state variables based on some input data, which can then be sent to other objects for use in their calculations or stored in the module as a state variable in an object called a “quantity”. Quantities are Cortix-specific objects that use Pandas dataframes to easily store and retrieve data; each quantity contains data about the specific state variable’s name, unit, the name with which the unit should be graphed, and the value of the unit at every time that the Quantity is updated. Multiple different state variables can be tracked in the same Quantity, with each “row” of the quantity containing the information on each tracked state variable at a certain point in time, and each column being all of the values of a tracked state variable at all times. Singular points of data for a specific state variable can be retrieved at a certain point of time, or data for all tracked state variables can be retrieved by getting a single row of the Quantity. The Cortix Module superclass also contains methods to easily retrieve all values in the Quantity at all times and easily print and display them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cortix environment itself is managed by the “run” file, which handles all aspects of simulation set-up, port connection, module evolution and data graphing. It will first import all the modules and libraries required for the simulation to run, and then set up storage objects which contain the parameters required by every module that will be instantiated. Then, a number of modules are instantiated as unique members of a specific Cortix module class, and are then connected to each other’s ports. The ports themselves are just lists of names kept by each module, which the run file then refers to in order to connect two ports together so that modules may pass data to each other. It does not matter if all the ports a module has are connected or not, the simulation will still run normally as long as a check is made to see if a port is connected before passing a send or receive function. At any rate, once all modules are instantiated and their ports are connected, the simulation will then run each of the modules on their own individual thread. The modules will evolve from their start time to their end time independently, as defined by their relevant internal functions (see below). They will pass data to each other independently, and when all the different modules have reached their end times then the simulation will end. At this point, graphs may automatically be generated by the run file from the quantities data stored by each module, and saved to the working Cortix directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set-up described above is extremely powerful, as the end user only needs Cortix modules and to know which ports to connect to each other to run a simulation and obtain data. The Cortix back-end infrastructure handles the messy business of module evolution, multithreading, communication and data printing without any required user input besides declaring which modules will be used, their starting parameters and how they will be connected to each other. It is therefore possible for an end user to run a simulation using “black box” modules, the inner workings of which they are unaware of besides the names of the relevant quantities they want to view at the end of the simulation, the port names of the modules themselves and the names of the parameters that are required for successful simulation. This is also an extremely powerful feature of the Cortix environment, as with proper documentation the modules may be easily implemented by users running different simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do the modules themselves work as they are evolved over a certain period of time? The answer to this is through each module’s run() function, which any properly implemented Cortix module must have defined by the programmer of the module. The internal implementation of the run() function can realistically be done in any manner, as long as there is some method by which the module will loop over a certain defined time span until the end-time defined in its parameters is reached. In the recommended implementation (which is used in the three modules that our group developed over the course of the semester), the run() function will contains a while loop which begins at the parameter-specified start time for each module; Then, it will run a “call_ports” function, which sends and receives information to and from all its connected ports using the Cortix Module .send and .recv functions. It will then run the module’s own internal mathematical functions which are used to update the module’s state vectors, after which it will update the module’s current “time” by moving it forward one “time_step”. Once the while loop has terminated (the module has reached its predefined end-time), the run() function will close, and once all open run() functions have closed simulation will halt and the modules Quantities may be accessed for graphing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall now discuss the specific implementation of the three modules that were created and implemented into Cortix modules by our group this semester, namely: bwr, turbine and condenser. Each of these contains mathematical models which calculate the state parameters (at this point, temperature, pressure, and flow quality) of the cooling fluid passing through them, as well as a few other variables which are dependent on the specific module."

    "The first (and perhaps most important) module that we implemented is the one which models the neutron and heat transfer kinetics within a boiling water reactor via a point reactor model, called bwr. The variables it tracks as quantities are the prompt and delayed neutron densities within the reactor (saved in the neutron_phase), and the average temperature of the nuclear fuel(saved in the reactor_phase), with the temperature of the coolant leaving the reactor being an  Additionally, functionality is given to send and receive data to other modules on the current coolant temperature within the reactor through its three (currently used) ports: coolant-inflow, coolant-outflow, and signal-out. coolant-inflow is where the reactor will get the state of the coolant entering the reactor (typically pumped in from a condenser), coolant-outflow is where the reactor sends the state of the steam that leaves the top of it (typically sent to a turbine), and signal-out is used to send data on the current state of the reactor to other unit operations within the balance of plant so that the coolant being sent back into the reactor arrives at the correct temperature and pressure for smooth operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module itself uses a two-temperature point-reactor simulation method with moderator temperature feedback, part of which was modeled and programmed by Dr. V. F. Almeida. The internal helper functions which are used to model the kinetics of this reactor take as argument the temperature of the coolant entering the bottom of the reactor and use its own state variables (quantities) which keeps track of neutron density and fuel temperature to calculate the neutron density at the end of each time step and the temperature of the fuel and the coolant at the end of each time step as well. The internal logic proceeds as follows: First, within the run() loop, the internal function __step() is called. The first thing this function will do is call all of the bwr module’s ports, either sending data to them using the send() function or receiving input data from the recv() function. Input data that is received is typically passed directly to the solver (more on that later), and output data is retrieved from the quantities history at time stamps specified by the module issuing the call for data from the bwr. Next, the module will build a vector of initial quantities that will be used to solve the differential equation that spans the current and next time step; this vector consists of the starting neutron and delayed emitter concentrations, the average temperature of the nuclear fuel and the average temperature of the coolant. Neutron and delayed emitter concentration densities, as well as the average fuel temperature are retrieved from the quantities data which is stored by the module itself, with average coolant inlet temperature being provided by the coolant-inflow port. Once this state vector is built, it will be passed to Numpy’s ode solver and solved numerically by the governing differential equations which apply to every value in the initial state vector.\n",

Note that the calculation of all these equations is handled by a function called f_vec which is passed to the ODE integrator, which takes as argument a vector containing the initial values of the 9 variables (neutron density, the six delayed precursor densities and the temperature of the fuel and the coolant) and calculates the output values after a full residence time for the numerical integrator, which runs these calculations until conversion is reached. The internal helper functions which are described above are called within the f_vec function as needed.\n",
    "The final major equations that pertain to the boiling water reactor module are the calculations which much be done to find the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient and the overall reactivity at any point in time.

The reactor module itself displays some rudimentary control logic where  is calculated and set in order to bring the reactor to the desired steady state neutron density by a more-or-less linear decrease in the overall reactivity (not including the effect of moderator temperature). All of these effects are calculated by the rho_func() helper function, which is called in f_vec() as a helper function.

Finally, the current time of the reactor (self.time) is advanced by one time step.

    "As can be seen by the graphic, a boiling water reactor module boils up steam and passes this to a high pressure turbine’s inflow port. The turbine expands the steam from whatever pressure enters the turbine to about 0.5 mPa, and then passes this off to two low pressure turbines which further expand the steam to about 0.5 bar. This is then passed on to the condenser, which subcools the low pressure turbine runoff and passes it back into the bwr to be boiled up again. Our group ran a simulated startup to examine its behavior.\n",

    "During startup, all three of the turbines are “tripped” until a certain reactor pressure is reached to allow pressure to build up in the reactor. The reactor itself initially receives a positive reactivity insertion as well as a kick from an initial neutron source. The source is quickly removed, and then control rods gradually drop into the reactor to reduce reactivity until the desired steady-state neutron concentration is reached. Once this occurs, thermal equilibrium is reached between the fuel and the coolant, and the system settles in to its steady state values."

As neutron density approaches the steady state value (1), it levels off as the control rods drop in and bring total reactivity to zero."

The numbers on the y-axis here are also relative, this time to the smallest delayed neutron emitter concentration (so the highest emitter concentration is about 450x more abundant than the lowest delayed emitter concentration). The shape of the curves is exactly as we would expect; however, the actual ratios seem to be a bit off, and further investigation will need to be made to ensure that the delayed neutron emitter balance is set up properly."

    "The temperature of the fuel displays an initial slight jump in temperature from its initial value of around 293.15 K to a little over 300 K as the neutron source is inserted, causing a small amount of fission and an increase in temperature. As the neutron source is removed, the temperature stops increasing until neutron density begins to pick up at around five minutes, after which time it rapidly increases to its ending average value of around 930 K. The small discontinuity just before the fuel temperature reaches steady state is due to an error in the condenser that causes its output temperature to drop by about 10 K that we were not able to fix in time for the final presentation. This sudden decrease in inflow temperature initially brings the temperature rise in the reactor to a halt before continuing to increase later on to its final steady state value."

    "The temperature rise of the coolant follows more or less the same pattern as that of the fuel, which is as we would expect since their heat balances are so closely connected. A final temperature of around 430 K is a bit low but still in the realm of possibility. Another interesting thing to note is that the drop in the coolant temperature after the drop in the condenser runoff temperature is much sharper then the drop in fuel temperature at this same period of time. This is due in part to the fact that nuclear heat production has almost reached its steady-state value by the time this occurs, and so a slight decrease in the coolant temperature will therefore result in an increase in the heat transferred to the coolant from the fuel and a slowdown of further heat increases. There will however be an immediate 15 degree drop from the coolant due to the decrease in the temperature of the condenser runoff."

The drops are quick, but not immediate, proving that the iterations used to calculate turbine runoff have at least some efficacy."

    "The high pressure turbine and low pressure turbines have the same graphs for power due to another bug in execution that couldn’t be ironed out before the due date, and so only one is presented here. Power generated by the turbine rises extremely quickly due to the sensitivity to the temperature of the steam entering the turbine (as it is generally a two-phase mixture, increases in temperature will also result in an increase in pressure and a correspondingly high enthalpy increase). This can also be seen in the large falloff in turbine power around 12 minutes due to a decrease of only around 20 degrees K in the temperature of the steam being drawn off the top of the reactor (see Fig. 6). Final steady state power generation of about 80 megawatts is also within the realm of possibility for a reactor operating at temperatures of about 450 K and with steam flowrates of 1820 kg/s."

Outflow state will begin as a subcooled liquid, and then increase in temperature until it becomes a two-phase mixture at the critical-point temperature at 0.5 mPa, at which point only outflow quality will continue to increase. The initial plateau in outflow temperature is seen to be consistent with the initial plateau in reactor runoff temperature as the effects of the initial neutron insertion become lost."

    "Overall, besides a bug in how the condenser and low-pressure turbines functioned, results obtained from this network simulation were at least theoretically possible, although at this point in time we do not have hard validation with other sources/simulations. What we do have, however, is a set of modules implemented in a network which can serve as the basis for future forays into modelling the nuclear reactor’s balance of plant. Our work proves that effective nuclear network simulation can be performed with Cortix and further expanded into more complex networks and modules if given more time."
